/// \defgroup TNT Tanks and Taps
/// Tanks and Taps defines a modular, composable framework for financial smart contracts. The fundamental design is
/// that asset can be held in containers called tanks, and can be released from those tanks by taps, which are
/// connected to other tanks or accounts. Tanks can also have attachments which provide additional functionality.
/// Taps can have requirements and limits specifying when, why, and how much asset can be released from them.
///
/// These modules can be assembled into structures that model real-world contracts. The tank stores the funds that
/// are allocated for the contract, and holds these funds in an intermediate stage of ownership, during which no
/// particular account owns them or has arbitrary access to them. Different accounts can be given limited access to
/// dispense the funds through taps, perhaps with limits or requirements which must be fulfilled before asset can be
/// released.
///
/// An example of a TNT contract is an HTLC, or Hash/Time-Lock Contract, which is a smart contract where some account
/// locks funds up such that they can be relased to another account if that account can provide the preimage to a
/// hash embedded in the HTLC. If the receiving account provides the hash, the funds are released to her; however, if
/// she has not claimed the funds with the preimage by a predefined deadline, then the sending account can recover
/// the funds. To construct such a contract with TNT, the sending account creates a tank with two general-use taps,
/// one with a hash preimage requirement connected to the receiving account, and the other with a time lock
/// requirement connected to the sending account. The sender funds the tank, and if the contract is accepted, the
/// sender provides the receiving account with the preimage, allowing her to withdraw the funds. Otherwise, the
/// sender can reclaim the funds through the time locked tap after the deadline passes.
